OPENVL
======

The purpose is to work on the opendata.vlaanderen.be datasets.

Initially we want to check the quality of the datasets related to the specifications in the manual.
In a second step we want to analyze the data to check if links or combinations will make sense. 

The approach now is in two steps:
1. Download dataset metadata for all datasets.
2. Analyze datasets locally.

Rationale is that the 'analyzing' phase is where new approaches will be explored, so lots of rework and testing will be required there. By downloading datasets in a separate step, the analyzing step will work in a more efficient way.
